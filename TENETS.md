# Carbon Graphs Developer Tenets

Below are the tenets that drives the project:

-   `Driven by semantics` - the markup should be meaningful, and accessible
-   `Designed to encapsulate separate concerns` - markup, styles, and interactivity should be separate concerns
-   `Driven by standards` - use standards when available
-   `Enhanced progressively` - should provide the most basic functionality and upgrade to higher fidelity
-   Treats extension as a `first class concern` - ensure that the component can be easily extended
-   `Built to be testable` - ensure that components are easy to test
-   Heavily rely on `S.O.L.I.D` design principles for development
